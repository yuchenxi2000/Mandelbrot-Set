## Description

![formula](http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?%5Cdpi%7B200%7D%20%5Csmall%20z_%7Bn%7D%20%3D%20z_%7Bn%20-%201%7D%5E%7B2%7D%20&plus;%20c%2C%20c%5Cin%20%5CBbb%20C)

You can choose the number of iterations. The greater the number is, the longer it takes to draw the image.

You may run the application on Mac OS . Windows users may simply download the jar file and double click to launch. (I'm sorry, but I don't know how to archive on Windows :( )
